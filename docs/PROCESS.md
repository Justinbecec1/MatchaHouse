Answer all Base questions plus:

Self-review patterns. Did the AI consistently catch certain types of issues during self-review (e.g., edge cases, missing error handling)? Did it ever miss something you caught yourself?

Yes most of the time when I ran the self-review, the AI was able to catch certaom edge cases, and some errors that I missed. However, in some points of the assingments, I realized that the AI missed some important accessibility issues, mainly regarding the dark mode, I eventually asked the AI to review the code again with a focus on accessibility, and it was able to fix those issues.

Browser tool vs. CLI comparison. If you’ve used Claude Code CLI or another terminal tool, how did the browser-based experience compare? What’s better/worse about each?

The browser based tool in my opinion is more user friendly, and easier to get started with, the setup was super simple and only required 2 clicks. CLI based tools from my experience can be a bit more intimidating for new computer users, the setup requires more similarity with the command line, and this can seem daunting to some. Although the actual coding experience in the CLI can be more efficient for some users, as the AI can run code quickly and download things on your device, the browser is more limited in that sense.

When would you use micro-iteration + self-review? For what kinds of tasks does this workflow make sense? When would you skip it?

micro-iteration is used for when a task is too big to tackle all at once, and it needs to be broken down into smaller steps. This workflow is best used for AI since big chances can create a lot of errors, and it gives time for the AI to catch those errors and review the code slowly. Self-review is used for those smaller steps to ensure that the AI is on task and cathching any errors that may arise.
