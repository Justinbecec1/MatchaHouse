Claude Agent
Removed blossom tree icon from all 4 HTML files
Done. The blossom tree image has been removed from all pages. The navigation now shows just the text "Matcha House" as before.

I dont want the nav bar sticking to the top can you make it so it doesnt for all pages

Claude Agent
Updated navbar positioning and adjusted related sections
Done. The navbar is no longer fixed to the top - it now scrolls with the page. I also adjusted the padding on the hero and page headers since they no longer need extra space for a fixed navbar.

Remove the emojis to make it more proffesional and I want dark pink as the color
